# Custom Cake Design Application - Proof of Concept (PoC)

## Project Scope
### MVP Objectives
1. Core Cake Design Functionality
2. Basic User Management
3. Initial Admin Console
4. Payment Integration
5. Fundamental AR Preview

## Technical Architecture
### Frontend
- Framework: React.js with Next.js
- State Management: Redux
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- 3D Rendering: Three.js
- AR Integration: AR.js or WebXR

### Backend
- Language: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication
- Payment: Stripe Integration

### Infrastructure
- Cloud Platform: AWS or Google Cloud
- Containerization: Docker
- Deployment: Kubernetes

## Core Features for PoC

- Social Login (Google, Facebook)
- Email Authentication
- Basic Profile Management
- Role-based Access Control
  - User
  - Baker/Restaurant
  - Admin

### 2. Cake Design Interface
- Basic Shape Selection
  - Round
  - Square
  - Rectangle
- Simple Layer Management (Up to 2 layers)
- Basic Decoration Options
  - Fondant
  - Buttercream
- Freehand Cutting Tool (Basic Implementation)

### 3. Admin Console
- User Onboarding Management
- Basic Analytics Dashboard
- User Role Assignment
- Simple Reporting

### 4. Payment Integration
- Stripe Checkout
- Basic Order Creation
- Simple Pricing Calculation

### 5. AR Preview
- Basic 3D Cake Rendering
- Simple AR Placement (Mobile Web)

## Development Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation (4 weeks)
- User Authentication System
- Basic Database Schema
- Initial Design Interface Prototype

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (4 weeks)
- Cake Design Tools
- Basic 3D Rendering
- Payment Gateway Integration

### Phase 3: Admin Console & Polish (3 weeks)
- Admin Management Interface
- AR Preview
- Initial Testing and Refinement

## Technology Stack Rationale
- React/Next.js: Rapid development, server-side rendering
- Firebase Auth: Quick, secure authentication
- Stripe: Standard payment processing
- MongoDB: Flexible schema for future expansion
- Docker/Kubernetes: Scalability and deployment consistency

## Scalability Considerations
- Microservices Architecture Preparation
- Modular Design for Future Food Industry Expansion
- Abstraction Layers for Future Feature Addition

## Performance Targets
- Page Load Time: < 2 seconds
- Design Interaction Latency: < 100ms
- Mobile Responsiveness: Full support

## Potential Challenges & Mitigations
1. 3D Rendering Performance
   - Optimize 3D models
   - Implement lazy loading
2. AR Compatibility
   - Fallback to 3D preview
   - Detect device capabilities

## Cost Estimation
- Development Resources: 3-4 Full-time Developers
- Estimated PoC Development Time: 11-12 weeks
- Estimated Initial Budget: $50,000 - $75,000

## Risk Mitigation
- Incremental Feature Rollout
- Continuous User Feedback
- Flexible Architecture Design
